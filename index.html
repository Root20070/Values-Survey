  <p class="mb-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
    The year <strong>2075</strong> marks a pivotal moment in human history as, after half a century of growing government surveillance and data control, citizens of the world collectively rejected centralised authority and the surveillance state. 
    VPNs, once optional, became as essential as running water. Public trust in governments and institutions eroded, banking systems were replaced with decentralised currencies, and communities regained their autonomy to combat global challenges. 
    This new era of independence led to innovation and creation, including a tool to fight global warming as well as a new educational system, <strong>Root</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
    <strong>Root</strong> was developed as a decentralised educational platform, independently founded and operated outside government control. 
    In this new world, knowledge spreads through a global network where anyone can share verified information, allowing learning to evolve beyond traditional structures. 
    Root has fully replaced conventional schools and universities as the primary source of education, ensuring that information is delivered in a factual and unbiased manner, free from governmental influence.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
    Our group’s three core values;<strong>individual autonomy</strong>, <strong>knowledge integrity</strong>, and <strong>equal opportunity</strong>,are the foundation of Root. 
    Individual autonomy represents the privacy and self-governance people regain through decentralised technology. 
    Knowledge integrity reflects our commitment to honesty, transparency, and accuracy in education. 
    And equal opportunity means everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, has access to learning in this new world.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
    We ask that respondents indicate, by marking or entering a number, how they believe society balances our three selected values in <strong>2025</strong>. 
    We then ask you to repeat this for the year <strong>2075</strong>, assuming the widespread use of our new educational platform <em>Root</em> in place of traditional educational institutions.
