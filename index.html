  <h1>Exploring Future Values in the Digital Society</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome! 👋 This short activity is part of a university project exploring how
    social values might change by the year <strong>2075</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll be asked to consider three values:
    <strong>Autonomy</strong>, <strong>Knowledge Integrity</strong>, and
    <strong>Equality</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the next page, you’ll place one dot in each of two triangles —
    one for how you think society values these <em>today</em> and one for
    <em>2075</em>. It takes less than two minutes to complete, and your responses
    are anonymous.
  </p>

    <h2>About Root</h2>
    <p>
      The year 2075 marks a turning point in human society. After decades of growing
      government surveillance and data control, citizens around the world collectively
      rejected centralized authority and the emerging <em>social panopticon</em>. Tools like
      VPNs became as essential as electricity or running water, symbolizing a new era of
      personal privacy and autonomy. As public trust in institutions collapsed, traditional
      banking systems gave way to decentralized currencies, and communities began using
      their newfound freedom to tackle global challenges—most dramatically through the
      invention of a giant ice cannon designed to reverse climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Root</strong> emerged within this landscape as a decentralized educational
      platform, entirely independent from government or corporate influence. Anyone can
      share verified information for learning purposes, creating a global, peer-to-peer
      network that has replaced traditional schools and universities as society’s primary
      source of knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our group’s three guiding values—<strong>Individual Autonomy</strong>,
      <strong>Knowledge Integrity</strong>, and <strong>Equal Opportunity</strong>—define the
      principles that shape Root. Individual autonomy reflects the privacy and self-governance
      regained through decentralized technology. Knowledge integrity expresses the ongoing
      commitment to truth, transparency, and accuracy in education. Equal opportunity ensures
      that everyone, regardless of status or geography, has fair access to learning in this
      post-institutional world.
